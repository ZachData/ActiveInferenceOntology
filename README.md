# ActiveInferenceOntology
Building an active inference-driven research navigation system that leverages AWS infrastructure (EC2, S3, RDS) and LLMs to analyze active inference papers and guide researchers to the most informative content based on their learning goals, optimizing what one should learn next through information-theoretic paper selection.

**Step 1: Infrastructure Setup**
1. **Goal**: Create scalable AWS infrastructure for paper processing and analysis
   * Set up EC2 instance for computation
   * Configure S3 for paper storage and embeddings
   * Establish RDS for structured metadata and relationships
2. **Tools**: AWS SDK, Terraform/CloudFormation for IaC
3. **Objective**: Create robust, scalable infrastructure for paper processing pipeline

**Step 2: Data Processing Pipeline**
1. **Goal**: Build automated pipeline for paper ingestion and analysis
   * Implement arXiv paper harvesting
   * Extract text from PDFs/LaTeX sources
   * Process with LLMs for key concepts/definitions
2. **Storage Structure**:
   * Raw papers in S3
   * Metadata and relationships in RDS
   * Embeddings for semantic search
3. **Objective**: Automate paper processing and information extraction

**Step 3: Knowledge Graph Construction**
1. **Goal**: Create multi-layer knowledge representation
   * Papers (citations, references, temporal relationships)
   * Authors (collaborations, institutions)
   * Concepts (definitions, mathematical formulations)
2. **Implementation**:
   * Graph database for relationships
   * Concept evolution tracking
   * Citation network analysis
3. **Objective**: Build structured representation of active inference literature

**Step 4: Active Inference Implementation**
1. **Goal**: Apply active inference principles to paper selection
   * Define information gain metrics for papers
   * Implement sampling strategies
   * Create cost functions for human attention
2. **Components**:
   * Expected knowledge contribution calculation
   * Resource allocation optimization
   * Reading order recommendation
3. **Objective**: Optimize human learning efficiency through intelligent paper selection

**Step 5: Research Navigation Interface**
1. **Goal**: Create user interface for research exploration
   * Paper recommendations
   * Concept exploration
   * Learning path generation
2. **Features**:
   * Interactive network visualization
   * Concept dependency mapping
   * Customized reading lists
3. **Objective**: Enable efficient navigation of active inference literature
